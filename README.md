Rate Your Date is a full stack MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js mockup of a dating website. It displays a theoretical feature that allows users to write a review about their experience after a date with a match. 


## Getting Started
The concept of this theoretical app revolves around a mission to enable people to rate their experiences with current or former matches, without the focus becomming strictly negative. Ensuring this would require that reviews be left throughout the duration of the connection, starting from the beginning, in order to provide a more accurate account of the overall dating experience with each person, encouraging mutual accountability and consideration.

A user can log in using Google and is immediately taken to their main profile page, displaying their own images and reviews they've left for other users. If they would like to leave a new review, they must create that user in the system. (For mockup purposes, this is presented as "searching for" that user in the system.)

If they have already left reviews for a user, they can click on "details" to see the profile and review they've left for a previous match.

Once on a user's profile page, they can make edits to their review. (Theoretically for the concept, they would have to do this within 72 hours of leaving the review, but this is mentioned for mockup purposes only.) They may also choose to delete their review.

Once the logged in user leaves or edits a review, the upated versions displays on the user's profile.

## Technologies Used
The Rate Your Date website was built using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Schemas were build to enable functionality between the database and client display, allowing users to create match profiles and edit reviews associated with each match. The form to leave a review is embedded within the match schema.

## Initial Planning and Wireframes

## Next Steps
- Better styling on all pages
- Improved functionality for edit and review forms
- Enhance features for displaying an average review score with color coding
- Use of an AI chat bot to simulate direct message chatting
- Use an array of random images to populate when creating fake "match" accounts and profiles
