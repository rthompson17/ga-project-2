Rate Your Date is a mockup of a dating app with a feature that allows users to rate their experience after a date with a match. 

Visit here: https://rate-your-date.herokuapp.com/matches

## Getting Started
The concept of this theoretical app revolves around a mission to enable people to rate their experiences with current or former matches, without the focus becomming strictly negative. Ensuring this would require that reviews be left throughout the duration of the connection, starting from the beginning, in order to provide a more accurate account of the overall dating experience with each person, encouraging mutual accountability and consideration.

## Technologies Used
The Rate Your Date website was built using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Next Steps
- Better styling on all pages
- Improved functionality for edit and review forms
- Use of an AI chat bot to simulate direct message chatting
- Use an array of random images to populate when creating fake "match" accounts and profiles
